            <p>Will you do the same for me? It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse. Heard it's beautiful, be the judge and my girls gonna take a vote. I can feel a phoenix inside of me. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Yeah, you take me to utopia.</p>

                  <p>Standing on the frontline when the bombs start to fall. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Can't replace you with a million rings. Boy, when you're with me I'll give you a taste. Thereâ€™s no going back. Before you met me I was alright but things were kinda heavy. Heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>

                      <p>Greetings loved ones let's take a journey. Yes, we make angels cry, raining down on earth from up above. Give you something good to celebrate. I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath. I'm ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. As I march alone to a different beat. Summer after high school when we first met. You're so hypnotizing, could you be the devil? Could you be an angel? It's time to bring out the big balloons. Thought that I was the exception. Bikinis, zucchinis, Martinis, no weenies.</p>

              <p>She'll turn cold as a freezer. At the eh-end of it all. Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes. Bikinis, zucchinis, Martinis, no weenies. I hope you got a healthy appetite. We can dance, until we die, you and I, will be young forever. We're living the life. We're doing it right. Word on the street, you got somethin' to show me, me.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">Wanna see the show in 3D, a movie. They say, be afraid you're not like the others, futuristic lover. Open up your heart. So I sat quietly, agreed politely. Last Friday night. Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane. I'll be your gift, give you something good to celebrate.</p>
